<h1>TabCounter</h1>
<p>This Tabcounter was created for AstraeusTF on Twitch. It is used to count the amount of times Tab is pressed and display that number on stream.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Compiling</h3>
<p>With AutoHotKey installed, right click the script and select "Compile". Run the compiled .exe file. Press Tab once and a new file, "TabCounter.txt" should be created. </p>
<h3>Setup in Streamlabs</h3>
<p>In streamlabs, got to Sources and add a new source, Text (GDI+). Ignore the default options it gives and select "Add a new source instead". Check the "Read from file" box and browse to the previously created .txt file.</p>
<p>To quit the program, navigate to the Windows systray and right click the AutoHotKey icon and select "exit".</p>
